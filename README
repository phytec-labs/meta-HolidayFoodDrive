This meta layer enables the Holiday Food Drive Demo on the phyBOARD-Electra
(and can serve as a reference meta-layer for preparing production-ready software images)

Verified using BSP-Yocto-Ampliphy-AM64x-PD23.2.0

Requirements: 
  - PCM-072.A2 (HS-FS SOM)
  - SSD1306 OLED Module (I2C LCD) connected to I2C1
  - Load Cells and HX711 Module connected to GPIO0_18 (DOUT) and GPIO0_83 (PD_SCK)
  - USB Speaker

Meta Layer provides:
  - dependencies for AWS GreenGrass: https://docs.phytec.com/latest/phycore-am64x/3rdpartyintegration/aws-gg.html
  - systemd service to poll the weight scale and display the weight on the I2C display
  - systemd service to poll the weight scale and play X-mas music when a change in weight is detected

In order to enable this:

  bitbake-layers add-layer <path-to>/meta-HolidayFoodDrive

Enable the layer and simply rebuild the BSP:

  MACHINE=phyboard-electra-am64xx-2 phytec-headless-image

weight-scale.service and weight-scale-sound.service (systemd services) will be enabled and running upon boot (just need the hardware all connected-up for this to work)
