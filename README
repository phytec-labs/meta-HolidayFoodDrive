This meta layer enables the Holiday Food Drive Demo on the phyBOARD-Electra

Requirements: 
  - PCM-072.A2 (HS-FS)
  - SSD1306 OLED Module (I2C LCD) connected to I2C1 - (helpful guide to verify display: https://www.electronicwings.com/arduino/oled-graphic-display-interfacing-with-arduino-uno)
  - Load Cells and HX711 Module connected to GPIO0_18 (DOUT) and GPIO0_83 (PD_SCK) - (helpful guide by Maddy!: https://wiki.phytec.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=~mbrown&title=HX711+Scale+Integration)

Meta Layer provides:
  - dependencies for sound and AWS GreenGrass, however both of these were setup on the target. Sound may be added back to this meta-layer in the future.
  - systemd service to poll the weight scale and display the weight on the I2C display

In order to enable this:
